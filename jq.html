  <h3>What is meaning of Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet?</h3>
  <div width="420" height="240">
    <p>
        
        Although the phrase is nonsense, it does have a long history. The phrase has been used for several centuries by typographers to show the most distinctive features of their fonts. It is used because the letters involved and the letter spacing in those combinations reveal, at their best, the weight, design, and other important features of the typeface.
        A 1994 issue of "Before & After" magazine traces "Lorem ipsum ..." to a jumbled Latin version of a passage from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, a treatise on the theory of ethics written by Cicero in 45 B.C. The passage "Lorem ipsum ..." is taken from text that reads, "Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit ...," which translates as, "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain...
        During the 1500s, a printer adapted Cicero's text to develop a page of type samples. Since then, the Latin-like text has been the printing industry's standard for fake, or dummy, text. Before electronic publishing, graphic designers had to mock up layouts by drawing in squiggled lines to indicate text. The advent of self-adhesive sheets preprinted with "Lorem ipsum" gave a more realistic way to indicate where text would go on a page.

  <h3>Ancient Paradox: egg or hen???</h3>
  <div width="420" height="240">
    <p>
            
            Although the question is typically used metaphorically, evolutionary biology provides literal answers, made possible by the Darwinian principle that species evolve over time, and thus that chickens had ancestors that were not chickens,[4] similar to a view expressed by the Greek philosopher Anaximander when addressing the paradox.[3]

If the question refers to eggs in general, the egg came first. The first amniote egg — that is, a hard-shelled egg that could be laid on land, rather than remaining in water like the eggs of fish or amphibians — appeared around 312 million years ago.[5] In contrast, chickens are domesticated descendants of red junglefowl and probably arose little more than eight thousand years ago, at most.[6]

If the question refers to chicken eggs specifically, the answer is still the egg,[7] but the explanation is more complicated. The process by which the chicken arose through the interbreeding and domestication of multiple species of wild jungle fowl is poorly understood, and the point at which this evolving organism became a chicken is a somewhat arbitrary distinction. Whatever criteria one chooses, an animal nearly identical to the modern chicken (i.e., a proto-chicken) laid a fertilized egg that had DNA identical to the modern chicken (due to mutations in the mother's ovum, the father's sperm, or the fertilised zygote).[8][4][9][10] Put more simply by Neil deGrasse Tyson: "Which came first: the chicken or the egg? The egg — laid by a bird that was not a chicken."[11]

Alternatively, if the question refers specifically to the chicken egg as it exists today, the answer may be different. Chickens produce a protein, ovocleidin-17 (OC-17), that is expressed in the uterus and causes the formation of the thickened calcium carbonate shell around modern chicken eggs. Because OC-17 is expressed by the hen and not the egg, the bird in which the protein first arose, though having hatched from a non-reinforced egg, would then have laid the first egg having such a reinforced shell: the chicken would have preceded this first "modern" chicken egg.[9][12] This is only the case, however, if OC-17 arose after the domestication of their wild-fowl ancestors gave rise to chickens.

  <h3> Did Rockfeller come to Shaki, Azerbaijan? </h3>

            At the turn of the 20th century the world’s #1 oil producing field was in the prosperous port city of Baku, in Azerbaijan. The famous Nobel brothers of Sweden launched the Baku oil boom in 1873. Soon huge oil tankers from that region were traversing the globe.
            Then, in 1883, oil companies owned by the Rothschild family entered the scene in Baku followed by Rockefeller’s gigantic Standard Oil Company. Heated competition was on for control of the world’s top producing region.
            At the time, Rockefeller and Rothschild were competing as the world’s foremost oil and banking barons. But the two competitors each finally realized that competition was not a good thing. The more oil wells they drilled, the more oil was produced, the more the price of oil per barrel fell. This led a disgruntled John D. Rockefeller to exclaim, “Competition is a sin!”
            A solution, therefore, was soon brokered. It was decided that the world’s markets would geographically be carved up, with the two barons, Rockefeller and Rothschild, each having their separate, well-defined shares. Moreover, limits would be put on oil produced globally so as to keep the market price as high as possible. Under this arrangement, both Rothschild and Rockefeller would benefit.
            Of course, all other competition would be squelched, driven out of business, including the Nobel Oil Company in Baku.
            The next course of action was that the Rockefeller-Rothschild cartel and their banker associates (Schiff, Warburg, Morgan, et al) proceeded to fund and sponsor the Bolshevik Communist revolution of 1917. Their puppets, Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin, soon reigned over the vast Soviet Russia empire.
            In April of 1920, Lenin, following orders from the Rockefeller-Rothschild cartel, went into action in Baku. Bolshevik troops and irregulars attacked and conquered the country of Azerbaijan and launched an all-out assault on Baku. Hundreds of thousands of residents were slaughtered, especially the families of the oil company executives, engineers, and chief workers. Their luxurious mansions and homes were plundered, wives and children raped, tortured and murdered. Then the oil derricks and facilities of Baku were set on fire—torched.
            Whoosh! Instantly, one of the world’s top oil producing regions was no more. The Nobel brothers fled for their lives back to Sweden, suffering a huge financial loss. Naturally, the Baku oil assets of Rothschild and Rockefeller were lost as well, but this was according to plan. That plan dictated that Russia would, during the Communist era, not be a world player in oil.
            This closing of Baku immediately resulted in an astronomical increase in the global price of oil. Rockefeller and Rothschild were well compensated for the temporary loss of their Baku assets. “Creative Destruction” had brought fabulous riches to these two corrupt Illuminati dynasties.
            Now, in 2010, consider: The planet is once more awash in petroleum (oil). The price in 2008 of $147 per barrel had, just two years later, plunged to $78, and even more oil is being daily discovered. Voila!—tragedy struck one of the world’s premier oil producing regions, the U.S.A.’s Gulf of Mexico.
            Hey, 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon fiasco—look in the mirror. Do you see your own image there staring back, circa 1920, in the “Creative Destruction” of Baku’s oil fields?
